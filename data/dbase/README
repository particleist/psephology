The data in a single python database/dictionary.

The constituencies are a dictionary with the constituency name as a key.
Each constituency is itself a dictionary, whose key is the election year.
Both these dictionary keys are strings.

Each constitutency only has entries for those years for which it existed.

Each result is accessed by using the year as a key, and contains

WINNER , VOTES : PAIR OF (STRING,INT)
SECOND PLACE , VOTES : PAIR OF (STRING,INT)
ELECTORATE : INT 
TURNOUT : DOUBLE

This data format is optimized for following the evolution of constituencies
as a function of time, other methods of indexing are of course possible.
